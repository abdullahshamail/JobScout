•	BARMC (SIGSPATIAL 2024)
Created the Bond‑Aware Relaxed Moving Clusters (BARMC) algorithm (SIGSPATIAL 2024), introducing spatio-temporal clustering and efficient event detection primitives that delivered ~1.7x faster hydrogen-bond (HB) analysis and enabled real time processing of 800k-frame molecular simulations.
Built a scalable ML-ready pipeline (SIGSPATIAL 2024) for real time HB detection and persistence modeling, integrating temporal reasoning, structured sequence extraction, and scientific visualization for 6k-atom MD systems, supporting downstream predictive modeling and simulation-ML workflows.
•	Compression and Performance Engineering (ADBIS 2022)
Developed a trajectory-compression and spatial-pruning framework that achieved 80% storage reduction and 3× faster analytical queries, substantially improving the efficiency of representation learning, motif extraction, and long-horizon analysis on high-resolution molecular trajectories, achieving an award at ADBIS 2022.
•	SDMC Framework (Pending Submission - 2026)
Designed the Semantic Diversity in Moving Clusters (SDMC) framework, implementing Brute-Force, ED-SDMC, and Grid-SDMC algorithms that achieved 17 to 65 times speedups using indexing, embedding-based similarity measures, and spatial partitioning, advancing diversity-aware clustering in dynamic environments.
•	Motif Mining and Scientific ML (Pending Submission - 2026)
Developed large-scale motif-mining pipelines leveraging geometric descriptors, spatio-temporal statistics, and learned embeddings to identify aromatic ring-pair configurations predictive of HB persistence - enabling new scientific ML approaches for event prediction and simulation understanding.
